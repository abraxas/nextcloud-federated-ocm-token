# nextcloud-federated-ocm-token

**Nextcloud Server** `35.0.0` - Nextcloud GmbH

A federated share secret is minted as an unscoped `PERMANENT_TOKEN` app password for the sharer. The recipient API returns it as `refresh_token`. Replaying it as Bearer on the sender WebDAV logs in as the sharer and reads files **that were never shared**.

**A bad actor you federated-share one file with can log in as you on your Nextcloud, skip 2FA, and read or overwrite all of your files, not just the one you shared.**

## What an attacker can do

You share **one** file or folder with `bob` on another Nextcloud. Nextcloud mints a 32-character secret, stores it as **your app password**, and hands that secret to Bob as `refresh_token`.

Bob (or anyone who converts your **public link** into a federated share) then:

- **Logs in as you** on **your** server
- **Reads every file** in your home, not only the shared node
- **Overwrites** those files
- **Skips your 2FA** (app-password path)

They do not get a PHP shell on the host. They do not need your password. Do not accept the share and do not call OCM `access-token` first: that exchange locks filesystem scope. The lab proves the **pre-exchange** secret.

## How I found it

A share is supposed to be a share. One file. One folder. I read `FederatedShareProvider::createFederatedShare` on tag v35.0.0. It mints a 32-character secret as `IToken::PERMANENT_TOKEN` for the sharer with no scope. `PublicKeyToken::getScopeAsArray` defaults `SCOPE_FILESYSTEM => true`. That is an app password. `Session::tryTokenLogin` takes a permanent Bearer.

The OCM exchange work (PR #57234 / #57166) already locks filesystem scope **after** the first exchange. An unofficial writeup used that post-exchange hop. I tried it first. On this tree the exchanged token is `TEMPORARY`, named `OCM Access Token`, and `/remote.php/dav` rejects it (`allowOcmAccessToken` false). DAV said no.

So I did not exchange. `ocm_discovery_enabled` stayed false so the recipient would not exchange it for me. Two official `nextcloud:35.0.0-apache` boxes, `overwrite.cli.url` as docker DNS (`http://sender` / `http://recipient`). Leave that at `127.0.0.1` and S2S talks to itself.

Alice shares one file with `bob@http://recipient`. Bob reads pending shares. `refresh_token` length 32. `access_token` length 0. Unauthenticated Bearer GET of Alice's private witness file, never in the share, returned **200**, `X-User-Id: alice`.

Target **only** `http://127.0.0.1:18340` (sender) and `:18341` (recipient).

## The fix

Mint the federated secret with filesystem scope false from the first insert. Do not accept that secret as Bearer/Basic on `/remote.php/dav`. First exchange already locks FS scope; create should never have handed out an app password.
